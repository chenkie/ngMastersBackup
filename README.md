Ryan, pursuant to the code provided by you, and the codpen that you shared, i have tried to incorporate 'AUTH_REQUIRED' in the code. i have two states (/masters and /auth) in my application. i would like to direct the user to /auth even if the user were to enter /masters. so the default state of my application shld be /auth. 

I haev the code (in the 'auth' folder under 'components' and the 'app.js' file in 'scripts' folder); it's a mess and i'm afraid, i wasn't quite able to follow the AngularFire documentation on this subject.  i realize you're gonna be havin a video of this out soon, but i was wonderin if you cld provide some guidance on where im goin wrong with this. thanks.

PS: Ryan, this is just a thought. if the production of the screencast is getting delayed, do you think it cld be helpful if you can share the code for Firebase authenitcation (tied in to the ngClasssifieds app) with  comments and instructions (some documentation) that students could students could follow.
