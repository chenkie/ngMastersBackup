Ryan, pursuant to the codpen that you shared, i also looked at the AngularFire resource and tried to incorporate 'AUTH_REQUIRED' in the code. i have two states (/masters and /auth) in my application. i would like to direct the user to /auth even if the user were to enter /masters. 

The foll is my code (app.js); it's a mess and i'm afraid, i wasn't quite able to follow the AngularFire documentation on this subject.  i realize you're gonna be havin a video of this out soon, but i was wonderin if you cld provide some guidance on where im goin wrong with this. thanks.

PS: Ryan, this is just a thought. if you feel the production of the screencast is getting elayed, it would probably be helpful if you can share the code for Firebase authenitcation (tied in to the ngClasssifieds app) with  comments and instructions that students could students could follow.
